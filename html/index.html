<h1>Chapter 1. Rationale</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
  <li>There a need to have 1 million published posts in the client website within time range of 3 years.</li>
  <li>1.000.000 / 3 = 333.334 posts annualy.</li>
  <li>333.334 / 365 = 913.24 ~ 914 posts a day ~ 1000 posts a day.</li>
  <li>Here, the objective is obvious, i.e., 1,000 published posts a day</li>
  <li>Achieving 1000 published posts a day manually needs at least 100 bloggers/ content writers.</li>
  <li>Monthly payment for a serious content writer is around IDR 3,000,000.</li>
  <li>Hence, 100 x 3,000,000 = 300,000,000 monthly to manually publish 1000 posts monthly.</li>
  <li>Client does not provide that amount of budget to achieve the objective</li>
  <li>A possible solution to answer the challenge is a blogger bot, imitating a human blogger intelligence.</li>
  <li>Research is required to create the blogger bot.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem formulation</h2>
<p>How to compose and publish 1000 posts a day programmatically?</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>1,000 published posts in daily basis.</p>

<h1>Chapter 2. How-to</h1>

<h2>How to run</h2>

To start the publisher bot, simply write this in your dear terminal. Replace [directory] with directory name in which you put formated files to upload.

<pre style="padding: 0 0 0 20px">
node posting.js [directory]
</pre>

Example:
<pre style="padding: 0 0 0 20px">
node posting.js retrospective
</pre>

<h4>Reason for blogger bot running on separated client:</h4>

<p>This blogger bot system is AI-based at her core. Consequently, she will expectedly consume much computational power resources. If she runs in the VPS (Virtual Private Server), she will heavily burden the server when she does AI stuffs, such as Data Mining (DM), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep-Learning-Based Genesis AI (Gen-AI), etc. That heavy burden shall be moved to an individual client as her home and she shall dwell in there happily.</p>
<p>The expected result, any computational burden will have no effect on server at all. Because she does not sit in the server, uploading content will use front-end interface. Besides removing server burden, this method will lower security risk to server as well. Another benefit, any intermediary nodes in the internet realm will detect it as if she is a real human blogger while, in fact, she is just a human-like automation robot, a machine.</p>
